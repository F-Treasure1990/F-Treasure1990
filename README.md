I am currently a hobbyst developer, awwaiting to see where my obession leads me. Based in Birmingham, England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. Web-development has been my obsession for the past few years, exploring both front-end and back-end methodologies. Front-end developement has currently been my main focus, with the goal of learning more backend methologies as time passes. <strong>[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)</strong> is my lanaguage of choice currently but I hold hopes of getting the opportunity to work with other languages, such as C# / PHP.

```javascript
const thai = {
  pronouns: "she" | "her",
  code: [Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Python, Java],
  tools: [React, Redux, Node, Storybook, Styled-Components, Jest, Docker],
  architecture: ["microservices", "event-driven", "design system pattern"],
  techCommunities: {
                        coorganizer: "AfroPython",
                        speaker: "Latinity",
                        mentor: "EducaTRANSforma"
                      },
