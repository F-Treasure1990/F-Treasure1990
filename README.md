Web-development has been my obsession for the past few years, exploring both front-end and back-end methodologies. Front-end developement has currently been my main focus, with the goal of learning more backend methologies as time passes. <strong>[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)</strong> is my lanaguage of choice currently but I hold hopes of getting the opportunity to work with other languages, such as C# / PHP.
